        <h2>GUIDELINES FOR REVIEWS</h2>
        <p>
        We may provide you areas on the Site to leave reviews or ratings.
        When posting a review, you must comply with the following
        criteria: (1) you should have firsthand experience with the
        person/entity being reviewed; (2) your reviews should not contain
        offensive profanity, or abusive, racist, offensive, or hate
        language; (3) your reviews should not contain discriminatory
        references based on religion, race, gender, national origin, age,
        marital status, sexual orientation, or disability; (4) your
        reviews should not contain references to illegal activity; (5) you
        should not be affiliated with competitors if posting negative
        reviews; (6) you should not make any conclusions as to the
        legality of conduct; (7) you may not post any false or misleading
        statements; and (8) you may not organize a campaign encouraging
        others to post reviews, whether positive or negative. We may
        accept, reject, or remove reviews in our sole discretion. We have
        absolutely no obligation to screen reviews or to delete reviews,
        even if anyone considers reviews objectionable or inaccurate.
        Reviews are not endorsed by us, and do not necessarily represent
        our opinions or the views of any of our affiliates or partners. We
        do not assume liability for any review or for any claims,
        liabilities, or losses resulting from any review. By posting a
        review, you hereby grant to us a perpetual, non-exclusive,
        worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, assignable, and sublicensable
        right and license to reproduce, modify, translate, transmit by any
        means, display, perform, and/or distribute all content relating to
        reviews.

        As part of the functionality of the Site, you may link your
        account with online accounts you have with third-party service
        providers (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”) by either:
        (1) providing your Third-Party Account login information through
        the Site; or (2) allowing us to access your Third-Party Account,
        as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that
        govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent and
        warrant that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account
        login information to us and/or grant us access to your Third-Party
        Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions
        that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account, and
        without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any
        usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider of
        the Third-Party Account. By granting us access to any Third-Party
        Accounts, you understand that (1) we may access, make available,
        and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to
        and stored in your Third-Party Account (the “Social Network
        Content”) so that it is available on and through the Site via your
        account, including without limitation any friend lists and (2) we
        may submit to and receive from your Third-Party Account additional
        information to the extent you are notified when you link your
        account with the Third-Party Account. Depending on the Third-Party
        Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you
        have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable
        information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be
        available on and through your account on the Site. Please note
        that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes
        unavailable or our access to such Third Party Account is
        terminated by the third-party service provider, then Social
        Network Content may no longer be available on and through the
        Site. You will have the ability to disable the connection between
        your account on the Site and your Third-Party Accounts at any
        time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY
        SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS
        GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE
        PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Social Network Content
        for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy,
        legality, or non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any
        Social Network Content. You acknowledge and agree that we may
        access your email address book associated with a Third-Party
        Account and your contacts list stored on your mobile device or
        tablet computer solely for purposes of identifying and informing
        you of those contacts who have also registered to use the Site.
        You can deactivate the connection between the Site and your
        Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact information
        below or through your account settings (if applicable). We will
        attempt to delete any information stored on our servers that was
        obtained through such Third-Party Account, except the username and
        profile picture that become associated with your account.
