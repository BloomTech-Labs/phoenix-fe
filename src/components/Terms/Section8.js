              These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by
              us on the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire
              agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
              exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
              shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
              Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
              may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at

              damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
              reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
              these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or
              unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
