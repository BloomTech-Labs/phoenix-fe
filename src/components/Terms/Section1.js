          between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”)
          and Phoenix App ("Company", “we”, “us”, or “our”), concerning your
          access to and use of
          the https://phoenix-fe-production.herokuapp.com/ website as well
          as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile
          application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto
          (collectively, the “Site”). You agree that by accessing the Site,
          you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these
          Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE,
          THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST
          DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.   Supplemental terms and conditions
          or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are
          hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the
          right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to
          these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert
          you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these
          Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice
          of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically
          review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be
          subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to
          have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your
          continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use
          are posted.   The information provided on the Site is not intended
          for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
          jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
          contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
          registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
          Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from
          other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
          responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
          local laws are applicable.   The Site is not tailored to comply
          with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability
          and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
          Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be
          subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use
          the Site in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
          (GLBA).   The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years
          old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or
