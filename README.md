The current research suggests 40% of Americans are currently dating, 27% of
which are using online dating. This application is focused on serving a specific
niche of those daters, specifically widows, widowers, and divorcees. This group
in particular need a different platform than what is currently on the market. This
application is a hybrid of group meetings and dating individually. It will organize
events based on location and interests and draw enough users to create a party
type atmosphere to make connections less awkard and easier to make.

## APIs

## JSON Web T0ken

Internet standard for creating JSON access tokens signed using a private secret. Tokens are used to assert user authentication claims.

## Bcrypt API

Bcrypt is a password hashing function that scales with computation power and hashes passwords with a salt. This scalability accounts for rapidly evolving harware and constant password length.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. Currently there is no need for a .env file.
